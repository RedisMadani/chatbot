## Introduction

The chatbot application is designed to simulate conversation with users by generating text-based responses using the OpenAI API. It provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can type messages and receive automated responses from the chatbot.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface
- Real-time message exchange
- Integration with OpenAI API
- API key authentication
- Message history display
- Clear chat functionality

## Installation

To install and run the chatbot application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RedisMadani/chatbot-app.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution to restore NuGet packages and dependencies.

4. Run the application using the debugger or by pressing `Ctrl + F5`.

## Usage

Once the chatbot application is up and running, you can interact with it through the user interface. Here's a breakdown of the different components and their functionalities:

- **Neon Light**: This element adds a visual effect to enhance the appearance of the interface.

- **Message Display**: The chat conversation is displayed in this section. Each message is rendered as a separate block, alternating between questions and responses. The messages are stored in the `messages` list and dynamically updated when new messages are sent or received.

- **Text Input**: You can enter your API key in the password input field. This key is required for authentication with the OpenAI API. Additionally, you can type your message in the text input field to send it to the chatbot.

- **Send Button**: Clicking this button sends the message to the chatbot for processing. The message is then added to the message display along with the response generated by the OpenAI API.

- **Delete Button**: Clicking this button clears the entire chat history, removing all messages from the message display.

## Configuration

The chatbot application does not require any specific configuration. However, there are a few areas where you may want to customize or adjust the behavior of the application.

### API Key

To use the OpenAI API and generate responses, you need to provide an API key. Follow these steps to obtain an API key:

1. Sign up for an account at [https://openai.com](https://openai.com) if you haven't already.
   
2. Generate an API key through the OpenAI platform.

3. Copy the API key and paste it into the API key input field in the chatbot application interface.

Make sure to keep your API key secure and avoid sharing it publicly.

## Dependencies

The chatbot application relies on the following dependencies:

- **Newtonsoft.Json**: A popular JSON serialization library used for serializing and deserializing JSON data.

- **System.Text.Encoding**: A class that provides methods for encoding and decoding characters.

- **System.Net.Http**: A namespace that provides types for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses.

These dependencies are automatically resolved and downloaded when building the project.
